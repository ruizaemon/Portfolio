## Hello World

Hi, welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

### A simple introduction

I'm <span style="color:var(--color-pink);">**Daryl**</span>, born and raised in Singapore. I graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Japanese. I started my career as a software engineer at a Japanese startup company and I'm currently living in Japan!

This is my first time making a portfolio website as well as a blog. For this site, I've decided to use <span style="color:var(--color-primary);">**Astro**</span> for its speed and simplicity. I hope to use this platform to share my learnings and experiences in software development, engineering, or anything else I find interesting.

I'm currently studying Linux and networking in preparation for starting my own homelab.

If you have comments about this website or just want to say hi, feel free to contact me through my LinkedIn page or email! I'm always down for a chat.

### What next?

For this website, I still plan on adding many more features and improving the design.

On the home page, I plan to showcase a "tech stack" section as well as a "journey" section, maybe.

I plan to use the projects page to not only showcase projects but to use Astro's <span style="color:var(--color-primary);">**Islands Architecture**</span> to learn and play around with multiple other frameworks and libraries. I'll start with <span style="color:#4BB483;">**Vue**</span>, <span style="color:#00D1F7;">**React**</span>, and <span style="color:#F73C00;">**Svelte**</span>.

I wish I had more time...

Anyway, until next time!
